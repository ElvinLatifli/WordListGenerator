## HOW TO DONLOAD ##

To use it on your Linux system, follow the steps below!
- Download this project as zip. and zip it out. then in the console go to the directory where you extracted the file



## HOW TO USE? ##

Linux
-  hackrick -n 3 -x 6 -i "12345" -w wordlist

   where -n represents the minimum number of characters of the passwords to be generated. -x represents the maximum number of characters of passwords. The characters you write after -i will be used for the wordlist. -w specifies the name of the txt file.

Windows 

- python main.py -n 3 -x 6 -i "12345" -w wordlist
  
  all usage same as linux


# #------------------------------------------------------------#

It shows you the size of the password to be created during use. and it asks you to continue. If you type y, it starts creating the password. If your wordlist is large this will take some time. It shows you the estimated time. Avoid very large data unless necessary. This strains your machine and causes it to contract and overheat. If you want to give up at any stage, you can stop it with ctrl + c!

If you need help, just type hackrick -h
